- 👋 Hi, I’m @BeeHine
- 👀 I’m interested in incorporating Ardupilot Mission Planner and X-Plane 11 and Real Flight simulators
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SITL and need help getting these to work together. Especially, using Mission Planner on one computer and X-Plane on another. Also setting up Spektrum DX8 and Jeti Dx-12 controllers.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Mission Planner and X-Plane 
- 📫 How to reach me: heliarink@gmail.com
